## User Story

* As a social media startup
* I want an API for my social network that uses NoSQL database
* So that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
* Given a social network API
* When I enter the command to invoke the application
* Then my server is started and the mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
* When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
* Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* When I test API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
* When I test API POST and DELETE route sin Insomnia
* Then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user's friend list

## Walkthrough Video!
* I couldn't get reactions to delete in the video. I have since fixed the issue
